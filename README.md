1. Do the web pages in different topics change at different rates?
What are the implications of this for focused crawlers that need to keep a database fresh?

2. How topics evolve on the web? Is the rate of new pages arrival different for
different topics and how a focused crawler can keep a topic up to date and discover
new links related to the topic?
 
3. Are web pages stable regarding the relevance of a topic? In other words, how often
on-topic pages become off-topic (and vice versa) and how frequently does that happen?
